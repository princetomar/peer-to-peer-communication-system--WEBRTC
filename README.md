# Task is to implement a peer-to-peer communication system for audio and video streaming between devices using Flutter.

# Task Description:
Your assignment involves creating a peer-to-peer communication system allowing audio and video streaming directly between devices. The use of the WebRTC library is required to handle this peer-to-peer communication efficiently.

# Requirements:
1.	Implement audio and video streaming functionalities between Flutter apps on different devices.
2.	Utilize the WebRTC library for managing peer-to-peer communication for seamless audio and video transmission.
3.	Develop a signaling server to facilitate communication between clients. This server should handle events like incoming calls and notify clients accordingly.

# Deliverables:
1.	A Flutter application demonstrating the peer-to-peer communication system for audio and video streaming.
2.	Codebase showcasing the implementation of WebRTC for establishing direct connections between clients.
3.	Signaling server code to manage and notify clients about relevant communication events.
